REACT NOTES:

Node.js 

npm =node package manager npmjs.com find JS packages CLI=Common Line Interface

         2 terminals for windows (CMD and Powershell *Powershell is error prone) 

         Check Node version in terminal:    node --version
        <!-- space is important -->

        clear screen prompt (Windows = cls)(Apple = clear) 
        
        
        React is a JS library created by Facebook builds fast and interactive user interfaces.   Front end technologies. React is a piece of the UI it's
        independet isolated and reusable components are the building blocks 
        
        Root Components: App.js (script.js for me) 
        Every React app is basicially a  Component tree
        
        pwd for apple equals Project Word Directory
        
        To launch project, type:   npm start 
        
        CTRL+C stops everything

        HTML inside a JS file on REACT is actually JSX

        In HTMS class= is className=

        everthing has to be closed even inputs </input>

        Use .jsx for all components inside a react file
        files names start with lowercase

        all html elements inside a react file must be lowercase

        REACT Functions must start with uppercase

        Importing css files: import "./file.css";

        file explorer go to project then click on path then type "cmd"


EVERY COMPONENT NEEDS
        // 1 import .css (make it now if not done)
        // 2. create function with Capitalized name 
        // 3 used Divs and create classes
        // 4 export default

curly braces inside js acts as "instruction mode"
React doesnt usually use variables like "let" or "var"


"STATE VARIABLES" are immutable (can't change the valuable)
const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);

SAVING TO GITHUB FROM TERMINAL

1.) #create Github repository on webside and cop URL

2.) # initialize the repository
    git init

3.) # add the remote url
    git remote add origin <URL>

4.) # create a local copy
    git add .
    git commit -m "MESSAGE"

5.) # Push /upload
        # first push:
        git push -u origin master 

        # next time
        git push

CTRL+Click while hovering goes to the named FUNCTION

CTRL+P jumps to recently used files within working folder

To launch Command Center (find files fast) right click name of main folder at top then select Command Center  

Random photo generator online: picsum.photos (no www. needed)
works like Lorem Ipsum (random word generator) but for photos

useEffect();  uses two parameters  arrow function => and list of dependencies []


ARROW FUNCTIONS:

An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, with some semantic differences and deliberate limitations in usage:

Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments, or super, and should not be used as methods.

Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors. Calling them with new throws a TypeError. They also don't have access to the new.target keyword.

Arrow functions cannot use yield within their body and cannot be created as generator functions.

this. changes within a function will be different with an arrow function.  Need arrow function to make this. work within REACT

in JS this. will work the same with or without the arrow function.
