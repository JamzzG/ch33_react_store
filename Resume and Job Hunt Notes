What are my favorite work experiences where I shine?
Improving efficiency, problem solving, training methods and inventing.
Examples: At my current workplace we have rooms with over 48 different racks and interconnectivity between those racks to over 192 different servers within the rooms.

        As you can imagine, the lengths of fiber optic cable needed between the rooms varies greatly and the engineers don't always get it right.  So instead of wasting time meticulously routing cable through the room only to find the stated lengths are too short or too long, I created a simple excel spreadsheet that uses a person's average steps to calculate a very accurate estimate of the correct lengths needed.  It greatly improved accuracy and now prevents tha majority of incorrectly ordered fibers from being installed in vain.

        I've also created a number of physical tools that improve my job.  One example is Velcro funnel that combines up to 8 rolls of velcro into a single draw so we can save time when we need to custom cut multiple lenghts of velcro for our installations. We need thousands of these small custom lenghts per room and you can imagine the labor costs of cutting 8 at at time versus one at a time.
